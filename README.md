# Conclusions

#### 1. Odds that Ing. Pozil will eventually reach elevator?
 Chances he will get to elevator are approximately equal to **67.74%.**
#### 2. After how long can we claim he is in elevator with 75% certainty (assuming one step takes 20 seconds)?
Since his chance of getting to elevator at all are below 75%, we can never make such a claim.
